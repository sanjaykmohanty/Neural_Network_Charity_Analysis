# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to employ deep learning models to assess donation applicants. By training a deep learning model on a dataset, the model served as a binary classifier to predict whether applicants would be successful if given funding. 

The deep learning model performed supervised learning by training on the "feature" columns from the dataset to predict a "target" column containing binary values of "0" or "1". Significant preprocessing of data was required to optimize the performance and prepare it for the neural network model. The data was compliled, trained, and the results were evaluated. The details and results of this process are described below.
